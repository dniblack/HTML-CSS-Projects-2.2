# HTML-CSS-Projects
I will be using this repository for all of my coding projects while I take the HTML &amp; CSS course from The Tech Academy

With this, I will be learning how to further utilize GitHub while also practicing code, getting familiar with HTML & CSS, and creating projects with these two languages. This will also be used so that my instructor(s) can look over and review my code.

The languages used in this course will be:
HTML - The language for building web pages
CSS - The language for styling web pages
